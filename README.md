Drag'n Code
=====================

Our idea was to help beginners to discover programming and 
more specifically algorithms. To do so, we will create an 
online platform in which users will be confronted to logical 
problems they will try to solve.
Since the target is mainly new programmers, we really want to 
abstract the syntax part of programming so the user can totally 
focus on the logical part without regarding the programmation 
language : using drag and drop. Our platform will therefore be 
composed of several logical problems which we will call “levels”. 
When a player starts a level, the problem to solve will be 
detailed, and the user can access the Playground.
